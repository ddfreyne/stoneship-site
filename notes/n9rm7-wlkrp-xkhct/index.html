                <h1>People are bad at identifying invisible&nbsp;threats</h1>


<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made me realize once more that people are genuinely bad at identifying the risk of invisible&nbsp;threats.</p>

<h2 id="workplace-fire-alarm">Workplace fire&nbsp;alarm</h2>
<p>Case in point: a fire&nbsp;alarm.</p>

<p>A few years ago at a former workplace, the fire alarm went off. It had falsely gone off a few times before, so I was unsure whether this was genuine. I was figuring that out when four fire trucks pulled up outside, along with the police. Yes, this was a genuine fire&nbsp;alarm!</p>

<p>I stood up and told everyone to evacuate the building. I went to other rooms to get everyone to leave. But in the end, only a dozen out of 100–150 people evacuated the&nbsp;building.</p>

<p>While waiting outside, a coworker broadcasted a Slack message, in ALL CAPS, requesting the fire alarm to be turned off because they couldn’t work like this (sales, which needed to be on the&nbsp;phone).</p>

<p>The police explicitly prohibited us from going back inside. They needed to confirm that the fire hazard was resolved. Someone in our small group said they knew of a secret back entrance to the office, and a bunch of coworkers followed them back&nbsp;inside.</p>

<p>In the end, out of 100–150 employees, only 4 or 5 properly evacuated the building and stayed outside while the threat was still present. Luckily for everyone, it turned out there was no fire, but the alarm was&nbsp;real.</p>
