    <p>One way in which budgeting reduces financial anxiety is by predicting expenses based on the expected lifetime of a purchase.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Limited-lifetime items with non-trivial cost</span></h2><p>Some items have a limited lifetime (e.g. 4–5 years) and have a non-trivial cost (e.g. €1500). A non-trivial cost is a cost that, if it were to suddenly show up, would stir up my budget enough to cause stress. For me, these items fit primarily into three categories: <span class="sidenote-pre text-muted">(</span><span class="sidenote text-muted">This categorization isn’t all-encompassing: some items with non-trivial cost and limited lifetime don’t fit in properly, e.g. my glasses.</span><span class="sidenote-post text-muted">)</span></p><ul>
<li>Electronic devices: laptop, phone, speakers, external display, …</li>
<li>Larger appliances: dishwasher, washing machine, …</li>
<li>Furniture with limited lifetime: office chair, mattress, …</li>
</ul><p>This explicitly excludes items with non-trivial cost that have a long (expected) lifetime. For example, this does this not include my expensive (but gorgeous) kitchen table, which hopefully will last forever.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>How to budget for replacement</span></h2><p>To start, make a list of all items with limited lifetime and non-trivial cost (use the categorization above as a guideline). For each item, roughly estimate its remaining expected lifetime, and the cost to replace it. For example: I bought my MacBook Pro in late 2017 and expect its lifetime to be 5 years. At the time of writing (early 2021), the expected remaining lifetime is roughly 20 months, and replacing it would cost roughly €1500.</p><p>From now on, start budgeting each month the amount of money needed to cover the replacement cost in the expected lifetime. For example, the €1500 for replacing my MacBook Pro over the remaining 20 months of its lifetime comes down to €75/month.</p><p>For each future purchase with limited lifetime and non-trivial cost, do this budgeting calculation <em>right when you make the purchase</em>. For example, if I were to replace my MacBook Pro right now (assuming the replacement has the same cost of €1500 and the same expected lifetime of 5 years), I’d immediately start budgeting €1500 spread over 5 years, which comes down to €25/month. <span class="sidenote-pre text-muted">(</span><span class="sidenote text-muted">Budgeting software exists to make this easier! I use <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com">You Need A Budget</a>, which works nicely with this approach. I’m also keeping my eye on <a href="https://actualbudget.com">Actual</a>.</span><span class="sidenote-post text-muted">)</span></p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Lifetime vs. warranty</span></h2><p>It is safe to use the warranty period as the lifetime, but this can be overly pessimistic. For example, my 2017 MacBook Pro is out of warranty, but I expect to keep on using it for at least another year.</p><p>In the end, it comes down to how much risk (uncertainty) you’re willing to take on.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Advantages</span></h2><p>I am able to deal with unanticipated expenses easily. Ideally, I only replace the item once I have all the money for replacement saved up, but even if I need to replace it before its expected lifetime ends, I will at least have a helpful part of the money saved up.</p><p>I am able to find out which items have extended past its expected lifetime. While this does not require me in any way to replace them, I can do so with no financial impact.</p><p>It makes me prefer purchasing long-lasting items over short-lasting ones, as short-lasting items will have a potentially higher monthly cost (for budgeting) associated with them.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Disadvantages</span></h2><p>It looks rather gloomy to immediately start budgeting for replacing an expensive item, right after purchasing it.</p>
