    <p>Unexpected expenses can cause financial anxiety. This is true for me, even though I have a good salary and a solid emergency buffer. One way in which I reduce my financial anxiety is by predicting expenses based on the expected lifetime of a&nbsp;purchase.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Limited-lifetime items with non-trivial cost</span></h2><p>Some items have a limited lifetime (e.g. 4–5 years) and have a non-trivial cost (e.g. €1500). A non-trivial cost is a cost that, if it were to suddenly show up, would stir up my budget enough to cause stress. For me, these items fit primarily into three categories: <span class="sidenote-pre text-muted">(</span><span class="sidenote text-muted">This categorization isn’t all-encompassing: some items with non-trivial cost and limited lifetime don’t fit in properly, e.g. my glasses.</span><span class="sidenote-post text-muted">)</span></p><ul>
<li>Electronic devices: laptop, phone, speakers, external display, …</li>
<li>Larger appliances: dishwasher, washing machine, …</li>
<li>Furniture with limited lifetime: office chair, mattress, …</li>
</ul><p>This explicitly excludes items with non-trivial cost that have a long (expected) lifetime. For example, this does this not include my expensive (but gorgeous) kitchen table, which hopefully will last&nbsp;forever.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>How to budget for replacement</span></h2><p>Starting out with this technique requires some initial setup. Once that’s done, the technique is easy to apply on a monthly&nbsp;basis.</p><div class="run-in">
<h3><span>Starting out</span></h3>
<p>Make a list of all items with limited lifetime and non-trivial cost. You can use the categorization above as a&nbsp;guideline.</p>
</div><p>For each item, roughly estimate its remaining expected lifetime, and the cost to replace it. For example: I bought my MacBook Pro in late 2017 and expect its lifetime to be 5 years. At the time of writing (early 2021), the expected remaining lifetime is roughly 20 months, and replacing it would cost roughly&nbsp;€1500.</p><div class="run-in">
<h3><span>Monthly budgeting</span></h3>
<p>Each month, budget the amount of money needed to cover the replacement cost in the expected lifetime. For example, the €1500 for replacing my MacBook Pro over the remaining 20 months of its lifetime comes down to&nbsp;€75/month.</p>
</div><p>For each future purchase with limited lifetime and non-trivial cost, do this budgeting calculation <em>right when you make the purchase</em>. For example, if I were to replace my MacBook Pro right now (assuming the replacement has the same cost of €1500 and the same expected lifetime of 5 years), I’d immediately start budgeting €1500 spread over 5 years, which comes down to €25/month. <span class="sidenote-pre text-muted">(</span><span class="sidenote text-muted">Budgeting software exists to make this easier! I use <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com">You Need A Budget</a>, which works nicely with this approach. I’m also keeping my eye on <a href="https://actualbudget.com">Actual</a>.</span><span class="sidenote-post text-muted">)</span></p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Lifetime vs. warranty</span></h2><p>It is safe to use the warranty period as the lifetime, but this can be overly pessimistic. For example, my 2017 MacBook Pro is out of warranty, but I expect to keep on using it for at least another&nbsp;year.</p><p>In the end, it comes down to how much risk (uncertainty) you’re willing to take&nbsp;on.</p><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Advantages</span></h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>I am able to deal with unanticipated expenses</strong> in a straightforward, no-anxiety way. Ideally, I only replace the item once I have all the money for replacement saved up, but even if I need to replace it before its expected lifetime ends, I will at least have a helpful part of the money saved&nbsp;up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I see which items have extended past their expected lifetime.</strong> Because these items have been fully-funded, I can replace them with no financial impact — if I need or want&nbsp;to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It makes me prefer purchasing long-lasting items</strong> over short-lasting ones, as short-lasting items will have a potentially higher monthly cost (for budgeting) associated with&nbsp;them.</p></li>
</ul><div class="h2-separator"></div><h2><span>Disadvantages</span></h2><p>It looks rather gloomy to immediately start budgeting for replacing an expensive item, right after purchasing&nbsp;it.</p>
