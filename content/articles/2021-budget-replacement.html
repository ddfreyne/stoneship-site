title: "Budget for replacing past purchases"
---

<p>One way in which budgeting reduces financial anxiety is by predicting expenses based on the expected lifetime of a purchase.</p>

<h2 id="limited-lifetime-items-with-non-trivial-cost">Limited-lifetime items with non-trivial cost</h2>

<p>Some items have a limited lifetime (e.g. 4–5 years) and have a non-trivial cost (e.g. €1500). A non-trivial cost is a cost that, if it were to suddenly show up, would stir up my budget enough to cause stress. For me, these items fit primarily into three categories:<sup>1</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Electronic devices: laptop, phone, speakers, external display, …</li>
  <li>Larger appliances: dishwasher, washing machine, …</li>
  <li>Furniture with limited lifetime: office chair, mattress, …</li>
</ul>

<p>This explicitly excludes items with non-trivial cost that have a long (expected) lifetime. For example, this does this not include my expensive (but gorgeous) kitchen table, which hopefully will last forever.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-budget-for-replacement">How to budget for replacement</h2>
<p>To start, make a list of all items with limited lifetime and non-trivial cost (use the categorization above as a guideline). For each item, roughly estimate its remaining expected lifetime, and the cost to replace it. For example: I bought my MacBook Pro in late 2017 and expect its lifetime to be 5 years. At the time of writing (early 2021), the expected remaining lifetime is roughly 20 months, and replacing it would cost roughly €1500.</p>

<p>From now on, start budgeting each month the amount of money needed to cover the replacement cost in the expected lifetime. For example, the €1500 for replacing my MacBook Pro over the remaining 20 months of its lifetime comes down to €75/month.</p>

<p>For each future purchase with limited lifetime and non-trivial cost, do this budgeting calculation <em>right when you make the purchase</em>. For example, if I were to replace my MacBook Pro right now (assuming the replacement has the same cost of €1500 and the same expected lifetime of 5 years), I’d immediately start budgeting €1500 spread over 5 years, which comes down to €25/month.</p>

<p>Budgeting software exists to make this easier!<sup>2</sup></p>

<h2 id="lifetime-vs-warranty">Lifetime vs. warranty</h2>
<p>It is safe to use the warranty period as the lifetime, but this can be overly pessimistic. For example, my 2017 MacBook Pro is out of warranty, but I expect to keep on using it for at least another year.</p>

<p>In the end, it comes down to how much risk (uncertainty) you’re willing to take on.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p>I am able to deal with unanticipated expenses easily. Ideally, I only replace the item once I have all the money for replacement saved up, but even if I need to replace it before its expected lifetime ends, I will at least have a helpful part of the money saved up.</p>

<p>I am able to find out which items have extended past its expected lifetime. While this does not require me in any way to replace them, I can do so with no financial impact.</p>

<p>It makes me prefer purchasing long-lasting items over short-lasting ones, as short-lasting items will have a potentially higher monthly cost (for budgeting) associated with them.</p>

<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>It looks rather gloomy to immediately start budgeting for replacing an expensive item, right after purchasing it.</p>
