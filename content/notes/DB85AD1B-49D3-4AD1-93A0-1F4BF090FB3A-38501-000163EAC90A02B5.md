UX matters for tools created for developers for the same reason as it does for other tools.

Individual notes:

* [[Auto-expanding CLI command invocations hinders forward compatibility]]

## Consistency in command-line options
The following is a list of command-line options that I’ve noticed are in common usage. In **bold** are the uses that I believe must be the default.

* `-f`
	* force
	* file (either input or output )
	* from type (combined with `-t` as “to type”, e.g. `-f svg -t png` to convert form SVG to PNG)

* `-h`
	* **help**
	* hostname (perhaps prefer `-H` instead)

* `-i`
	* input file (combined with `-o` as “output file”)
	* interactive

* `-o`
	* output file (combined with `-i` as “input file”)

* `-t`
	* to type (combined with `-f` as “from type” e.g. `-f svg -t png` to convert form SVG to PNG)

* `-v`
	* version
	* verbose
