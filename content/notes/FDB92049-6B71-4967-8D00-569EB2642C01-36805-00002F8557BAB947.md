title: stderr is for all diagnostic output

For command-line program, stdout is used to output the result that the program produces. Anything else, i.e. diagnostic output, needs to be on stderr.

stderr is not for writing errors, confusingly. *All* log messages (not just errors, but also warnings, and even debug messages) belong on stderr.

If a command-line program takes a `-q` or `--quiet` option, then this would silence stderr, but not stdout—the output is the primary product, after all.

If the program doesn’t produce output, then the difference between stdout and stderr is irrelevant.
