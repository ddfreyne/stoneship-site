For command-line program, stdout is used to output the result that the program produces. Anything else, i.e. diagnostic output, needs to be on stderr.

stderr is not for writing errors, confusingly. *All* log messages (not just errors, but also warnings, and even debug messages) belong on stderr.

If a command-line program takes a `-q` or `--quiet` option, then this would silence stdout, not stderr.

If the program doesnâ€™t produce output, then the difference between stdout and stderr is irrelevant.
