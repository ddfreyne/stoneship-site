Grammar rules exist to keep the language coherent across space and time. It exists to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize ambiguity.

As language evolves, and communication mediums evolve as well, grammar rules must be updated to reflect new realities.

For example, [[URLs and paths require special word-breaking rules]] that would not normally be considered correct. The existence of URLs and file paths, however, creates a problem, because traditional grammar rules create ambiguity for URLs and paths.

Another example is related to compound adjectives. “Open-source software” needs a hyphen, because is a compound adjective. On the other hand, “a dimly lit room” does not need a hyphen, because an adverb and an adjective do not create a compound adjective. However, “a dimly-lit room” would be more consistent, and provides more information for the reader to reduce apparent ambiguity.
