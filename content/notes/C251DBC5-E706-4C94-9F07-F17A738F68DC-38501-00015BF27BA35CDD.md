This section of my web site is for collecting my mostly-unstructured thoughts. While not all the notes I take are public, I intend to publish as much as I can on here.

These notes are primarily intended for myself. They are public because I like working in the open, and it gives me the opportunity to share thoughts in a written-down form with others when the need arises.

These notes are not blog posts, and these [[Notes are not articles]]. They’re not continuously updated, and are not sorted chronologically. [[Short-form content doesn’t need to be written as a chronological sequence of blog posts]].

You might interested [[What’s top of mind]] for me now.
