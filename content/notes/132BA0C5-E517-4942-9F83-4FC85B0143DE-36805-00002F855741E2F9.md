In spreadsheets, cells are referred to as A1, B4, etc. These names are meaningless and make it too easy to introduce errors.

Some tooling (references needed) make it possible to give cells names, but these act as aliases only, and the primary way of referring to cells is still by its letter-and-number combination.
