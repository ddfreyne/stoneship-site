::**Note**: This is something I need input on. Fancy a conversation?::

The title of this note is pretentious: I don’t know how to do this properly, but at least I have an idea of what I’d like to try.

Even though I know quite a few people, I don’t feel as much of a sense of belonging as I’d like, and even when I feel it, it’s very rare. This sense of belonging comes from being member of a community. Unfortunately, the majority of people I meet up only in a one-on-one fashion, which does not build that sense of community.

Some ideas on how I could rekindle that sense of community:

- When planning for activities for myself (e.g. walking), low-key announce it some place and invite people to join if they want. ::**To do**: What does “some place” mean? This might not work for one-off activities, and might need regularly-scheduled ones.::

* When inviting people to anything I organize, make it clear that anyone is welcome to bring other people as well, *even if I don't know them*. (This is a very un-German and rather US thing to do.

* (Post-pandemic) Have a regularly-scheduled afternoon for meeting up. The location could be my own (ideal for a boardgame afternoon, for example), but it might also be good to have a fixed cafe to meet up at in case my place isn’t available.
