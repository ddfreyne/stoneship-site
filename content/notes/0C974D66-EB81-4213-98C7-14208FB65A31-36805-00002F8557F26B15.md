For a (presumably) fully-functional language, all we need is the following:

* Arrays
* `Array#each`
* Function definitions and calls

## Boolean logic
We can define the two boolean constants `YES` and `NO` like this:

```ruby
NO = []
YES = [ [] ]
```

An `IF` function can be defined with `lambda`, and uses `#each` (which will only yield for `YES`) to call the right branch:

```ruby
IF =
  lambda do |val, if_yes, if_no|
    val.each { return if_yes.call }
    if_no.call
  end
```

With `IF`, we can implement dyadic (“binary”) operations, such as `OR` and `AND`:

```ruby
OR =
  lambda do |val_a, val_b|
    IF[val_a, -> { YES }, -> { IF[val_b, -> { YES }, -> { NO }] }]
  end
```

This now works as expected:

```ruby
p OR[YES, YES]
p OR[YES, NO]
p OR[NO, YES]
p OR[NO, NO]
```

## Integer arithmetic
We can define `ZERO` and `ONE` in the same way `NO` and `YES`:

```ruby
ZERO = NO
ONE = YES
```

We can define successor function, which returns 1 more than the input:

```ruby
SUCC =
  lambda do |val|
    [val]
  end
```

We can define `TWO` this way:

```ruby
TWO = SUCC[ONE]
```

We can also define `PRED`, which returns the previous integer in sequence:

```ruby
PRED =
  lambda do |val|
    val.each { |e| return e }
    return ZERO
  end
```

With `PRED` and `SUCC`, we can define `SUM`:

```ruby
SUM =
  lambda do |val_a, val_b|
    IF[val_a, -> { SUM[PRED[val_a], SUCC[val_b]]}, -> { val_b }]
  end
```

Now this works:

```ruby
p SUM[ZERO, ZERO]
p SUM[ZERO, ONE]
p SUM[ZERO, TWO]
p SUM[TWO, TWO]
```
