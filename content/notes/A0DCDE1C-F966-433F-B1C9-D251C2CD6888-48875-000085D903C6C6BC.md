## Filter
In the real world, a filter is a device that separates one substance from another. See also `Enumerable#filter`, an alias for `#select`.

In Nanoc, a filter transforms data, e.g. from Markdown to HTML.

A better name in Nanoc would be *transform*.

## Identifier vs. path
Identifiers *are* technically paths as of Nanoc 4 (at least when not using the legacy identifiers), but there is a distinction which is not clear.

Better names could be:

- input path vs. output path
- raw path vs. compiled path
- raw path vs. cooked path
- raw path vs. baked path
