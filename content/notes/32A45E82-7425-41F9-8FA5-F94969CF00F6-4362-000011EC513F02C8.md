There are four ways of naming products:

You can name the product based on its **function**. For example: _editor_, _presenter_, _reviewer_. These names tend to be agent nouns.

You can name the product based on its **high-level object type**. For example: _tracks service_, _playlists service_, _retweets service_. I found that this approach works well for microservices, where each service encapsulates a domain.

You can name the product based on its **intended audience**. For example: _creator app_, _curator app_.

You can use a **codename** for the product. For example: _koala_, _rhyolite_[^rhyolite], _neptune_. This is particularly useful for products that are not yet stable and well-established, which might well be the case for all products that are in active development.

[^rhyolite]: Okay, maybe not “rhyolite”. Who will remember how to spell _that_?
