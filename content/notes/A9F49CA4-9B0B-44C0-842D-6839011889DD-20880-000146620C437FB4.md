# A good hyperlink has enough context to work around broken URLs
URLs serve only to locate resources, and don’t have intrinsic meaning. This can become a problem if a URL no longer leads to the expected resource (e.g. server returns 404 Not Found or 410 Gone).

URLs can “break” this way, but this does not mean the resource has vanished forever: it could have moved to a different URL, or there might be other copies of this resource elsewhere at different URLs.

A good (hyper)link provides context, to facilitate finding a replacement URL, in case the original URL no longer points to the expected resource. This context provides, at a minimum, the title and author of the resource.

::To do:: Figure out difference between context and link text (e.g. author doesn’t need to be part of link text)

Example:

> Denis Defreyne’s [Using Lenses](https://medium.com/bcgdv-engineering/using-lenses-b0251f7ca79) provides a method of building complex forms with React and TypeScript.

Further enhancements include using a formal citation format, as used in academia.
