The format that I like to use for bug reports (that I write myself, and that I like to receive) is as follows:

* Summary/title (one-line at most)
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior

Explicitly mentioning the expected and the actual behavior is useful to avoid any assumptions about what is expected behavior.

Optionally, provide context:
* OS version
* Interpreter version
* Package manager version
* Stack trace (if regarding a crash)
