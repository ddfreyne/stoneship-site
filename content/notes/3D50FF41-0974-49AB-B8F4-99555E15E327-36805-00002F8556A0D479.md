There are multiple ways of associating metadata in plaintext files, depending on the file format:

* The *Front matter* (used in Nanoc, Jekyll, â€¦) can be used for any plaintext file format.

* *AsciiDoc* has its own metadata format.

* *HTML* has `meta` tags.

## Impact on Nanoc
Nanoc only supports front matter natively, though with some preprocessor logic, other types of metadata could be extracted.
