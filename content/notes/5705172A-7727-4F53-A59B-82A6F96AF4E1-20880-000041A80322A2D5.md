A token generated for human consumption must have the following characteristics:

* It must not contain words that can have (negative) meaning
* It is must to read
* It must not have potentially ambiguous characters

For example, this is not a good human-usable token:

```
PY5FAGNNHTCYTAAG
```

This token is, however:

```
H4NL-N3PW-9RFJ-4TPX
```

To turn a random token into a human-readable token:

* Exclude vowels (A E I O U)
* Exclude ambiguous characters (B D G Q S Z and 0 1 2 5 6 8)
* Group characters in chunks of 4 or 5 characters, separated by dashes

This reduces the entropy in the generated token, but because tokens are easier to read and copy, they can be made longer.
