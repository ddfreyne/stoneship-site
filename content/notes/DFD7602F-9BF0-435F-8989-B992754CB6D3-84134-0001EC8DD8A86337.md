# A microservices architecture is object-orientation with big objects
[Dr. Alan Kay on the Meaning of "Object-Oriented Programming"](http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en):

> OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.

This applies to microservices as well:

* **messaging:** Microservices talk to each other over HTTP (or at least some kind of network protocol).

* **local retention:** Each microservice has its own state. (I’m treating a microservice as a collection of running instances.)

* **protection and hiding of state-process**: A microservice’s internal state can only be changed through messages.

* **extreme late-binding of all things**: Parts of a microservices architecture can (and are) deployed independently, changing their APIs and the way they communicate at runtime.
