For short-form web content where the publication date is not of primary importance, consider alternatives to the blog format.

::**To do**: This note has multiple ideas in it. On one hand, there’s the idea of *not* sorting writings chronologically. On the other hand, there’s the idea of continuously updating writing. For content that gets updated regularly, the revision date is more important than the publication date.::

## The blog: ideal for journals, less ideal for knowledge
The invention of the blog (née weblog) came with a new standard way to broadcasting written information: clearly date-stamped posts, sorted in reverse chronological order.

Putting the date front-and-central on each blog post can be problematic, because it reduces the up-to-dateness of a post to a single attribute. For example, for a blog post from 2018, it’s easy to make a “old and probably obsolete” snap judgement.

The nature of blogs makes this date stamp important, however. The blog format is a write-once, update-never format[^1]. The content in a blog post is not intended to be revised. If the content does require revision, a common approach is to mark the blog post as outdated, and write a new blog post, with a newer date stamp. Most often, though, old blog posts simply are not updated (they’re not meant to be) and become stale. The date stamp is thus necessary to identify potentially outdated content.

[^1]: “Update-never”, with the exceptional small spelling or grammar revision, or the addition of a “this post is outdated” notice near the top.

For content where the date is predominant, a blog is a good fit. A weekly log or a personal journal would not be what it is without a dominant date.

For knowledge work, on the other, the blog format is not ideal. Knowledge is inherently timeless and thus does not fit well into a collection of neatly-dated blog posts. Moreover, knowledge accumulates over time, and it makes sense for written content to be continuously updated. This, however, creates friction with the write-once, update-never format of blog posts. 

## Choosing notes over blog posts
Consider organizing short-form content where the publication date is not dominant in an “writing” or “notes” section, sorted alphabetically rather than by publication date. All writing in the _Notes_  section of this web site is an example of such content. If the amount of content is unwieldy for a single list, it can be worth grouping by topic.

It still makes sense to keep track of the creation and modification dates in the content management system[^2]. Publishing the creation date, however, does not—especially not front and center.

[^2]: A filesystem is also a content management system, albeit a rather crude one.

There is an additional, psychological benefit to not having clearly date-stamped blog posts. By having notes rather than blog posts, and thus no clear date stamps, I don’t feel as much pressure to keep my site up to date. I no longer feel apprehension about my site potentially appearing outdated, and potentially becoming irrelevant.

## Comparing blog posts to books
Books don’t mention the date when they were written on their cover, nor on the back side, nor on the spine. The information about when a book was written is usually in small print on the edition notice (copyright page). This is true for fiction books (which might never lose relevance[^3]), but also for non-fiction books, even those about software engineering topics that run the risk of becoming woefully obsolete in the next handful of years.

[^3]: A fiction book might go out of style, but it won’t become obsolete.

::**To elaborate**: Determining up-to-dateness when a date is not present, is more difficult. Consider a title that provides enough information (e.g. “how to upgrade to React 13” is clearly obsolete).::

Revising a book is time-consuming and expensive. Books are therefore inherently more write-only than online content. ::**Open question**: What does this mean? Do blog posts just date quicker? If so, why? Is it because blog posts are written with the intention of becoming obsolete anyway? Are we fetishizing freshness? Perhaps books don’t need their date stamp as clearly, because books are meant to be a long-lasting medium, and considerably more thought and research has gone into a book than in a blog post.::
