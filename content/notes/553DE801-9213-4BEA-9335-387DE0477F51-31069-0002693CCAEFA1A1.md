By having a dot-com domain for my full name, it unambiguously is my personal space, and it reduces the risk of impersonation.

I recently registered denisdefreyne.com and have switched my personal web site and email to it.

Previously, Iâ€™ve used denis.ws and stoneship.org. Both of them are still active: they redirect to the new domain, and both still receive mail.
