title: A globally-available filesystem prevents access tracing

Tracing filesystem access is useful to figure out what a certain part of a program does, and taking actions based on that, such as creating a file dependency graph.

Tracing filesystem access can only be done when the filesystem is not globally available. Otherwise, filesystem access tracing cannot be done reliably when multiple parts of a program access the filesystem in parallel.

Making the filesystem not globally available, and instead passing in the filesystem as a reference, would make this possible.

## Impact on Nanoc
For Nanoc, this is problematic because some filters do their own filesystem access, which Nanoc cannot trace, and therefore Nanoc cannot build the right dependencies.

## How tup does it
The [tup build system](http://gittup.org/tup/) uses FUSE to spin up a filesystem, which is globally available, but allows tracing because tup is fully responsible for the filesystem.
