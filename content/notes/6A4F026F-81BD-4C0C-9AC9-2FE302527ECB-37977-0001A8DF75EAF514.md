Now that I’ve established the [[Audience of my web site]], I can think about what content I can provide for this audience:

* **About/bio**: Generally useful. Might contain a link to [[What’s top of mind]]. Should contain links to other places, e.g. Twitter.

* **Talks**: A list of all talks. I’d like to present this as a portfolio, e.g. not just with links to slides, but also showcase slide design. Perhaps the talks page should come with a slide player, with transcript, on the site itself. Perhaps even an audio recording, synchronised to playing slides.

* **Articles**: This does not exist yet, but mature, fleshed-out articles would end up here. They might start out as a note, or a set of notes, in which case the notes would refer to, or redirect to, the new article.

* **Notes**: This is my digital garden where I collect learnings, thoughts, ideas, and more. What’s in here will be incomplete and keep evolving, which is fine.

* **CV/Résumé**: It’s good to have this on hand. It might be a sub-page of the About page. It does not need to follow the design of the site, and might even be separate entirely: perhaps a PDF itself is good enough.
