Being in the office does not imply being creative. (Nor does not being in the office imply being non-creative.)

Creativity cannot be scheduled, and a working environment that requires people to be in the office therefore wonâ€™t be the most conducive to producing results:

* When in the office while not being creative, people will stick around and either do work for which the output is of low quality (which might be worse than no output, as it can require rework afterwards), or perform menial tasks that might be of low value.

* When not in the office and being creative, people will not make use of that creativity, or use that creativity in other ways (not applied to work).
