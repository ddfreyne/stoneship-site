I’d like the audience of my web site to consist of the following:

* **Myself**: I keep an ever-evolving collection of notes that I can refer to and share with others when it is useful. I treat my list of notes as my external brain.

* **Prospective conference organisers**: My web site contains the list of talks that I’ve given, and this is good material for showing to prospective conference organisers for new speaking opportunities.

* **Prospective employers**: The list of talks I’ve given, the collection of software I’ve created, and the body of articles[^articles] I’ve written are useful as tools during interview processes.

* **Software engineering community**: I’ve gained plenty of experience and would like to share back to the world. This is where the body of articles comes in.

[^articles]: There are no articles on the site — yet. I hope to change that in the near future.
