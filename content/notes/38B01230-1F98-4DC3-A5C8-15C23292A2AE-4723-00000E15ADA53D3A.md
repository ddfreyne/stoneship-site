As I’m continually interested in [[Programming language design]], I find it interesting to look at languages that I like and use often, and 
This is a series of thought exercises to think through what 

* [[What would I change about Ruby?]]

::**To do**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, Python::

::**Idea**: A series on “What do I like about programming language X” would also be interesting and useful.::

## The rules
First of all: all proposed changes need to be justified. The justification doesn’t need to be thorough, but it needs to be there.

Furthermore, all proposed changes must work in a variety of situations:

- It must work at any stage of the project: whether it is just starting out as a greenfield project, or a years-old project.

- It must make sense for developers of any seniority: whether junior or senior.

- It must work for projects of any scale: whether just starting out, or a large codebase with hundreds/thousands of files and tens/hundreds of thousands of lines of code.
