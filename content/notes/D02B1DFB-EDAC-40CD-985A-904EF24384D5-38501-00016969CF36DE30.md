My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he). Here are some examples of how to use them:

* Denis is working from home. **He** is working from home.
* Denisâ€™ dining table is gorgeous. **His** dining table is gorgeous.
* I got a loaf of sourdough bread from Denis. I got a loaf of sourdough bread from **him**.

I am also fine with they/them/their.
