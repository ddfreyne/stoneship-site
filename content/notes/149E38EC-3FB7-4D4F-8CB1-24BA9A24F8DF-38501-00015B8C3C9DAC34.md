I’m looking for a new opportunity! Take a look at [my CV](https://denisdefreyne.com/cv/) and get in touch. You might be interested in [[The type of projects I’d like to contribute to]].

I’m rethinking the purpose of this web site. I’m thinking about the [[Audience of my web site]], as well as the [[Contents of my web site]].

I’m perpetually interested in [[Programming language design]]. I’d love to create my own programming language some day. Maybe it will even happen!
