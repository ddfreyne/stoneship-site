I’ve been thinking a lot about how to structure my own knowledge. Too often do I lose track of thought, so I’ve been note-taking in a more structured way, and publishing some of it on my web site. I’m continuously experimenting with how to organize my writing (see [[The format of a note]]).

I’ve also been thinking about continuous delivery (CD) for desktop apps: David Farley and Jez Humble’s book Continuous Delivery is good, but does not take into account desktop apps (user-installable apps).

I have a continuous interest in build systems. I’ve not written down much about build systems yet, but here’s a start: [[Build processes should only generate new files]].
