This note collects my current points of interest.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how to structure my own knowledge. Too often do I lose track of all my thoughts, so I’ve been note-taking in a more structured way, and publishing some of it on my web site. I’m continuously experimenting with how to organize my writing (see [[The format of a note]]).

At work, I’ve been thinking about the UX of developer tooling. This term has made people chuckle, likely because they don’t think that [[UX matters for developer tools]]—and I disagree.

Also at work, I’ve been thinking about continuous delivery (CD) for desktop apps. Jez Humble’s book Continuous Delivery is good, but does not take into account desktop apps (user-installable apps).
