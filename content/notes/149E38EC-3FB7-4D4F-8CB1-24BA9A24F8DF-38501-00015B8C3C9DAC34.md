This note collects my current points of interest.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how to structure my own knowledge. Too often do I lose track of all my thoughts, so I’ve been note-taking in a more structured way, and publishing some of it on my web site. I’m continuously experimenting with how to organize my writing; one of my last points of interest is [[Short-form content doesn’t need to be written as a chronological sequence of blog posts]].

At work, I’ve been thinking about the UX of developer tooling. This term has made people chuckle, likely because they don’t think that developer tooling needs good UX—and I disagree.

Also at work, I’ve been thinking about continuous delivery (CD) for desktop apps. Jez Humble’s book Continuous Delivery is good, but does not take into account desktop apps (user-installable apps).
