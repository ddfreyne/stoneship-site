At Pitch, there is a `#shipped` Slack channel, where engineers post any user-visible changes to the product they deployed to the internal build. The Slack messages include a short description, link to the Git changeset, and often a screenshot or even video.

Itâ€™s great to have changes to the product so visible. It encourages people to try out new and enhanced features, which is excellent for dogfooding. Slack threads provide a great way to discuss the changes in more detail, if necessary.

It is also used for release notes: the people writing release notes have an exact list of all the changes they can include in the release notes.
