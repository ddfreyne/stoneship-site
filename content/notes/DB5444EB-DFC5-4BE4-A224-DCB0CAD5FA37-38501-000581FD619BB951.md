I’m in favor of having a well-organized filesystem (see [[Organize electronic archive by year]]) that I can navigate quickly. When I don’t know exactly what I am looking for, I can still browse the filesystem and see what I find. If I were searching, I’d have to think up all the different search terms and wade through potentially tons of irrelevant search results.

The search functionality in many products is lacking. It’s either too slow to be usable (Notion) or the search results are mostly irrelevant (Confluence).
