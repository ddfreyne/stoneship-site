The audiences differ: I write my notes for myself, but I write articles for others to read.

While notes have fairly free-form content, articles are more structured. They open with a lead paragraph and often have a table of contents.

Notes are atomic and often address only one idea, while articles connect multiple ideas together in longer-form writing.

::**To figure out**: Articles can go into a feed, which will be chronological. How does that rhyme with my thinking that [[Short-form content doesnâ€™t need to be written as a chronological sequence of blog posts]]?::
