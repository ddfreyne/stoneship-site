These are tools that I use on a regular basis. I’ve left out common tools (Git, macOS, Docker, …).

## Desktop apps
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (macOS; productivity app) gives me the power to do all the things I want, right when I need them, without introducing clutter. I have a handful of custom workflows tuned for the way I work, which I imagine impresses my coworkers.

[OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) (macOS) is the best diagramming tool I know of. It isn’t cheap, but I find the $100 price tag to be worth it. I use it to impress my coworkers.

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) (macOS) is my window manager of choice. It replaced [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) which is no longer updated.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform) is my editor of choice.  I switched from [Atom](https://atom.io), which by itself is already an amazing piece of software, to Visual Studio Code, which is at the same level of awesomeness.

## Services
[Fastmail](http://fastmail.com) provides excellent email, but also web hosting and DNS management.

## Fonts
I swear by [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) and [Input](https://input.djr.com).

## CLI tools
[fish shell](https://fishshell.com) is a fast, easy-to-use shell that has sensible defaults. I have barely customised it.

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is my command-line grep alternative of choice.

[xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) is a must-have tool if you deal with CSV files. I think CSV is a pretty good format!

## Ruby gems
[hamster](https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster) provides efficient immutable data structures (which are sometimes more efficient than built-in Ruby ones).

[ref](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/ref) provides a soft ref implementation, which is indispensable for effective memoization.

[RuboCop](https://rubocop.org) indispensable when writing Ruby code. It pretty much eliminates all discussions about style.
