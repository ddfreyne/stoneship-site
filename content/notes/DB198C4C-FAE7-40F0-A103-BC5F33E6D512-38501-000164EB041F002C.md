When typing <kbd>nanoc co</kbd>, Nanoc will infer that to mean the same as <kbd>nanoc compile</kbd>. While this looks convenient, it prevents adding a command that <kbd>nanoc co</kbd> could complete to.

For example: <kbd>nanoc co</kbd> works properly out of the box:

```
% nanoc co
Loading site… done
Compiling site…

Site compiled in 0.37s.

%
```

However, if I were to add a new command called <i>correct</i> (which I can do because Nanoc loads <span class="path">commands/</span> subdirectory), then <kbd>nanoc co</kbd> stops working:

```
% nanoc co
nanoc: 'c' is ambiguous:
  compile correct

%
```

To keep forwards compatibility, don’t auto-expand CLI command invocations, and instead exit with a “did you mean” error. For example:

```
% nanoc co
nanoc: 'co' is not a known command.
  did you mean:
    compile

%
```

It’s worth hardcoding common shorthands: for example, <kbd>co</kbd> could always be short for <kbd>compile</kbd>, even if a <i>correct</i> command is added afterwards:

```
% nanoc co
Loading site… done
Compiling site…

Site compiled in 0.37s.

% nanoc correct
Correcting all the things… ok

% 
```
