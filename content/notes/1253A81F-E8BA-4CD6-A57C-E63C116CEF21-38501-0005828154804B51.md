While an enum with two choices might be encoded as a boolean, the semantics differ, and they need to be used in a different way.

Consider a `Target` enum:

```
enum Target {
  staging,
  production,
}
```

This could be encoded as a boolean (false is staging, true is production), but this limits extensibility.

Consider a function that returns the *other* target:

```
fun otherTarget(t: Target): Target
```

Adding a third option for target would break this function. It would be better to write it to return an array:

```
fun otherTargets(t: Target): [Target]
```

If there are only two options for Target, this would be a little strange: it would only ever return an array with one element in it. However, adding a third Target is now easy.

### Option types and lists
There is an interesting parallel between option types and lists. Consider an `otherTarget` function that could return a target or nothing:

```
fun otherTarget(t: Target): Option<Target>
```

The analogue for the `otherTargets` function (returning a list) is that this function could return a list of one element (if there is a target) or an empty list (if there is no target).

See also [[Minimal language with arrays in Ruby]], where false and true are encoded as an empty and a non-empty list, respectively.
