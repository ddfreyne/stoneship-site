Hyphenation can introduce hyphens into a URL or file path when breaking it across multiple lines. It will be unclear, however, whether or not the hyphen is meant to be part of the URL or file path. The [Yahoo! Style Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171040/http://styleguide.yahoo.com/editing/treat-abbreviations-capitalization-and-titles-consistently/website-names-and-addresses) (now archived) recommends the following:

* **Do not add hyphens when breaking.** It is unclear whether or not a hyphen at the end of the line is part of the URL or file path.

* **Do not break at hyphens.** A hyphen at the end of a line is problematic, for aforementioned reasons, but a hyphen before the end of a line is unambiguously part of the URL or file path.

* **Break *before* punctuation that can be interpreted as the end of a URL.** This includes the slash and the period. Breaking before such punctuation gives a clearer indication that the URL continues onto the next line.

* **Break after other kinds of punctuation.**

In HTML and CSS, set URLs and file paths to never break, with `hyphens: never`. Manually insert the empty `<wbr>` (word break) element at word-break opportunities, i.e. before slashes and periods. `<wbr>` creates word breaks without hyphens, which is ideal for URLs and file paths. For more details, refer to the [hyphens](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens) CSS property reference on MDN, or the [`wbr`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr) HTML element reference on MDN.

This web site follows these guidelines. For example: <span class="path">~/Library/Application Support/My app/ws.denis.something.a.very.long.period.separated.string/more/and/more/slashes/infinite/slashes/some text here that should not be broken/lorem ipsum dolor sit amet/lorem ipsum indeed</span>.
