(This is satire.)

The pandemic wasn’t that bad! We did not need masks after all.

We haven’t ever been hacked. We therefore don’t need a security team and are going to lay off everyone in that team.

There haven’t been any road accidents in our village, therefore we don’t need the road speed limits after all.

No building in our village burnt down in years! We should therefore not be funding our building safety inspectors nor the fire department.
