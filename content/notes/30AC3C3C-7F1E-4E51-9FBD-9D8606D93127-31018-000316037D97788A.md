# You are not paid to be busy
[[Offices and creativity are at odds]] because creativity can’t be scheduled, and it’s likely that at some point, people will be in a situation where they are in the office in a creative lull.

It should be totally fine to take a break, or even leave the office (go home) if the creativity is missing. [[Taking a break is better than excess context switching]].

This is unfortunately difficult in some working environments:

* In synchronous (in-office or remote) working environments, software engineers are generally expected to be present for upcoming meetings, and are expected to be readily available for collaboration (e.g. pair programming).

* In some synchronous (primarily in-office) working environments, taking a break or even not producing visible results is considered taboo. For example, a coworker once commented on me being lost in thought, saying *“uh, shouldn’t you be typing?”*

* Some working environments (in-office) have fixed working hours, which for any creative profession does not make sense and will yield inferior results. [[Asynchronous working environments make it easier to divide up time]] than synchronous working environments, but even those are still better than fixed-working-hours environments.

You are not paid to be busy. You are paid to produce results, or to increase the result output of the team/department.
