Over the course of the last few years, I’ve increasingly become aware of how things are not going in a good direction when it comes to society and environment. I’d like to apply my skills on projects that, in particular:

- are ethical
- reduce inequality; increase equity for minorities
- are sustainable (turn back the tide on climate change)
- advance economic and social justice
- improve accessibility

This rules out several sectors:

- Finance and banking, in particular projects that are aimed at increasing the wealth of the already wealthy.

- Cryptocurrencies (particularly proof-of-work and proof-of-space are vile concepts)

* AI projects with no dedicated ethics team
