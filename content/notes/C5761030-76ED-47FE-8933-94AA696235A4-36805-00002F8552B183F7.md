title: Nanoc sites take too long to load

Firstly, there’s the issue that [[Ruby can be slow for short-running apps because it needs to load (require) dependencies]].

Nanoc builds an in-memory list of all items, and that can take a while. Additionally, it builds pressure on the garbage collector, although that’s less of an issue in recent Rubies.
