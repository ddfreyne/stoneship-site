Mirroring (Voss and Raz 2017): In a conversation, repeat the critical (often last) three words of what your conversation counterpart just said, to fuel the conversation.

I’m imagining this as clicking on a hyperlink in a conversation: the three critical words are highlighted, and to continue the conversation, click on (i.e. repeat) those three critical words.

Some games (e.g. Wasteland 2) use the hyperlinked-words-in-conversation approach to drive conversation.
