#p[class=lead] This is the personal web site of me—Denis Defreyne. I am a software engineer based in Berlin, Germany, and my pronouns are %ref[url=https://pronoun.is/he/him]{he/him}.

#p In the past, I’ve worked for %ref[url=https://soundcloud.com]{SoundCloud} and %ref[url=https://bcgdv.com]{BCG Digital Ventures} (among others), and I am currently working for %ref[url=https://pitch.com]{Pitch}. I’m the creator of %ref[url=https://nanoc.ws]{Nanoc}, a mature static-site generator written in Ruby, and I led the implementation of %ref[url=https://closecontact.club]{closecontact}, a COVID-19 contact-sharing solution for Berlin clubs.

#p You might be here because you’re interested in the %ref[url=/software/]{software I’ve written}, the %ref[url=/talks/]{talks I’ve given}, the %ref[url=/notes/]{notes I’ve taken}, or the %ref[url=/toolbox/]{software that’s in my toolbox}. Or perhaps you want %ref[url=/cv/]{my CV}.
